							Hey there, fellow developers! I hope you're having a
							fantastic day and your code is running smoothly.
							Don't worry if it's not; we've all been there. I've
							been in the software development game for quite some
							time now, and I remember the days when I constantly
							searched for tools to make my life easier.
							<br />
							<br />
							Tools like Postman, Faker, JSON Placeholder and many
							others have been my trusted allies in those
							challenging times. They helped me test my APIs,
							generate fake data for testing, and even mock up
							entire backends. But even with these tools, I felt
							something was missing. I wanted a tool that would
							not only help me but also improve the workflows of
							other devs around the world.
							<br />
							<br />
							So, after many sleepless nights and countless cups
							of â˜• & ðŸ§‹, I'm thrilled to introduce you to
							BinaryTree - a tool born out of pure passion and
							determination. BinaryTree is designed to save you
							time and effort, streamline your workflow, and help
							you overcome the challenges we developers face
							daily.
							<br />
							<br />I believe that we rise by lifting others, and
							I hope BinaryTree will be a valuable addition to
							your developer toolkit. Happy coding!
							<br />
							<br />â€” A node in the BinaryTree.
